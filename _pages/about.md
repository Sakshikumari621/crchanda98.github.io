Hi, welcome to my profile. I am Arijit. By profession I am a meteorologist with more than eight years of experience in various fields including demand modelling, air quality modelling, NLP and energy forecasting. At present I am leading the technical team of weather and energy forecasting project. The details of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). In my off-time, I read books, learn new technologies (like I am learning how to use github.io), and explore music (finding new songs, humming them through my harmonica). I spend my holidays travelling across different places, making new friends, learning cultures and saving them in memory for me and through my lens for you!

My education journey
======
I hail from Birnagar, a small town from West Bengal with strong historical significance. Through my education and profession, I have spent significant amount of time at southern part of India. During my graduation at Pondicherry Engineering College, I was fortunate to learn about Tamil culture,language and their cuisine. A healthy GATE score after completing BTech opened up multiple options for me including sailing through academia pursuing masters and joining PSUs as graduate engineering trainee. But the most lucrative was the chance at IISc Bangalore for MTech in Climate Science. In 2016, I entered into industry after complete post-graduate from one of the esteemed college of India as well as World.

Professional life
======
After completing MTech, I joined CSTEP as research engineer. It was one of the leading think tank in Asia working on multiple domains related to public policy. They did not have any exparties in air quality modelling and they were looking for someone to start a team. Being the first team member, I took multiple technical initiatives including weather and air quality modeling, satelite data analysis and validation of model using remote sensing and measurement datasets. As a outcome, we Being good hold on programming, I used to collaborate with multiple teams to work on their mathematical modelling problems. In one of such collaboration on demand forecasting published [report](https://cstep.in/drupal/sites/default/files/2019-01/CSTEP_RR_Karnataka_Electricity_Demand_Forecasting_2017-22_March2018.pdf).

After completing them, I joined Parabole.ai as software engineer. Here I worked on unsupervised algorithm design for text analytics. The task was to design highly scalable text extraction algorithm which.
