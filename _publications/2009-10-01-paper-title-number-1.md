This project involved a comprehensive review of air quality data and studies for Bengaluru, India, with a focus on developing a multi-pollutant emission inventory at a 1-km grid resolution for the Greater Bengaluru region. The study utilized advanced particulate pollution dispersion modeling through WRF-CAMx models to estimate the contributions of both local and non-local sources to air pollution levels. Additionally, a detailed assessment of current and proposed interventions for improving air quality was conducted, providing valuable insights into effective strategies for mitigating pollution in the city. This work aims to contribute to ongoing efforts to enhance the sustainability and health outcomes of Bengaluru's urban environment.
